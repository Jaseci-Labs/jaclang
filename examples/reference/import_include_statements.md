Jac's import and include statements enable the integration of external modules, borrowing from Python's import system with notable enhancements for readability and functionality.

- **Python Imports:** Utilize `import:py` to seamlessly import Python libraries, allowing full access to Python's ecosystem within Jac programs.
- **Jac Imports:** Use `import:jac` for importing Jac-specific modules from `.jac` files, distinguishing Jac module imports from Python's.

The language supports importing specific elements from modules using an enhanced `from` syntax, aimed at improving readability and minimizing namespace clutter. This system facilitates a clear distinction between Python and Jac imports, ensuring an intuitive and efficient dependency management process.

In essence, Jac's import and include syntax provides a flexible and straightforward approach to leveraging both Python and Jac modules, enhancing code reuse and organization within Jac programs.
