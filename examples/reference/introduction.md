## Introduction

Welcome to the official reference guide for the Jac programming language. This document is designed to serve as a comprehensive manual, while also offering a formal specification of the language along with examples that demonstrates its capabilities and features. Our aim is to ensure that this guide reflects the latest developments in Jac, with all grammar snippets and code examples being directly generated from the actual grammar and test cases maintained in the official repository. While the descriptions may occasionally lag behind the rapid evolution of Jac, our approach of syncing with code base provide accuracy and relevance of the technical content, making this document a reliable resource for developers seeking to answer the question, "How do I code X in Jac?"
