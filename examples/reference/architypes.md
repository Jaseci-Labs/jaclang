The provided Jac code snippet demonstrates the use of archetypes (a key concept in Jac programming), which are similar to classes in other object-oriented programming languages. In Jac, archetypes can be defined using different keywords to signify their roles and characteristics within the program. These include `obj`, `node`, `walker`, `edge`, and `class`, each serving distinct purposes in the architecture of a Jac application.

**Defining Archetypes**

- **Object (`obj`)**: This keyword is used to define a basic archetype. In the example, `Animal` and `Domesticated` are simple archetypes with no inherited or additional members.

- **Node (`node`)**: Defines an archetype that can be part of a graph structure. `Mammal` is declared as a node and inherits features from `Animal` and `Domesticated`, demonstrating multiple inheritance.

- **Walker (`walker`)**: This keyword is used to define archetypes that perform actions or traverse nodes and edges within a graph. `Dog`, `Labrador`, and `DecoratedLabrador` are examples of walkers, with `DecoratedLabrador` also showcasing the use of decorators.

**Inheritance**

The example illustrates how archetypes can inherit from one or more other archetypes, using the syntax `:ParentArchetype:`. For instance, `Labrador` inherits from `Dog`, which in turn inherits from `Mammal`, indicating a chain of inheritance.

**Decorators**

Decorators in Jac, denoted by `@`, are used to modify or enhance the behavior of archetypes without altering their code directly. The `@print_base_classes` decorator is applied to `Mammal` and `DecoratedLabrador` to print their base classes at runtime, demonstrating a practical use of decorators for introspection or debugging purposes.
