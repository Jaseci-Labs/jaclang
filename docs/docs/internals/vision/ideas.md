#### Details

| Jason Mars  | Process | Specifying the Jaseci enhancement proposal process and guidelines |

#### Description
This process is inspired by python's pep system but much simplified. 

There are three categories of JSEPs that will be merged into this document, JSEPs accepted for inclusion in the language design and specification, idea's worth deep consideration, and idea's considered but rejected for now. 

All JSEPs will start in the deep consideration category and moved to either accepted, or rejected categories for long term archival. 


The process is as follows: 

* To submit an idea simply make a pull request including the idea to this document in the to be considered section using the same format (and linear number scheme) of other ideas in this document. 
* If the idea is merged into into main, it has made it through the first filter, if not, it will not be not enter the consideration phase.
* After necessary discussion / iteration the JSEP will move either into accepted or rejected categories. 
* Rarely, rejected JSEPs that was deeply consider may be resurrected in the future if circumstance provide. 

The types of JSEPs include: 

* Process - Proposal for implementation, improvements, or modifications to any processes associated to how Jaseci is maintained. 
* Technical - Proposals around, features, designs, or any technical aspects around Jaseci
* Informational - Any best practices, code style guidelines, or other official guidelines around how Jaseci should be used by the broader community. 

JSEPs can be iterated on at any time and evolve over time regardless of the category they are in wether accepted, under consideration, or rejected via further PRs. 

Feel free to use any/all features of markdown to clearly articulate your ideas in the body of your JSEPs such as code snippets etc!
