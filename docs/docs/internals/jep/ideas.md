# Jaseci Enhancement Proposals Guide

## What are JEPs?

The Jaseci Enhancement Proposal (JEP) is a design document that provides information about new features to the Jaseci community or explains a new design for existing features, procedures, guidelines, or changes to the process. The JEP is meant to be the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions.

## Why is the JEP System Needed?

1. **Standardization**: The PEP system provides a standardized way of proposing, discussing, and implementing changes in Python. It ensures that all proposed changes follow the same structure and are treated in the same way.

2. **Transparency**: The PEP process is fully transparent. All discussions and decisions are documented and made publicly available. This makes it easier for the Python community to understand why decisions were made.

3. **Community Involvement**: The PEP system is designed to ensure that decisions about Python are made in a way that involves the entire Python community. It allows all Python users to provide feedback and influence the direction of Python.

## How To Create a JEP

We use the documentation system and in particular this folder to manage JEPs. See the first accepted JEP (JEP 1) for more details.
