# Blue Pill: Jac Mapping to Python Semantics and Syntax

Jac is a data spatial programming language that goes beyond Python in several key ways. However it is a superset language semantically, so lets start with understanding Jac through the lens of how typical python style implementation is realized.

### General blue-pill tier differences / improvements over Python

While Python has been widely lauded for its readability and simplicity, Jac introduces several new features and structures that are aimed at providing even greater control, predictability, and flexibility to developers.

#### Whitespace Doesn't Matter

Unlike Python, where whitespace and indentations are crucial for the structure of the code, Jac relaxes these restrictions. Whitespace in Jac does not dictate code blocks; instead, the language reintroduces braces `{}` and semicolons `;` to delineate blocks and terminate lines respectively, reminiscent of many C-style languages. This allows code to be more compact when desired and offers flexibility in styling.

While Python places strong emphasis on the usage of whitespace and indentations for denoting the structure of the code, Jac has a more flexible approach. In Python, these strict formatting rules can occasionally lead to less concise code and even impede the readability of the code in certain scenarios. In Jac, the emphasis on whitespace does not exist, providing more freedom and flexibility to developers. This approach permits developers to create more compact and versatile code, while preserving the clarity and understandability of the code.

That being said, Jac acknowledges the value of the Python's black package, a code formatting tool that strictly enforces a uniform (and opinionated) standard code structure across a project, thereby enhancing a particular approach readability and maintainability. Thus, Jac has built this concept into the core of the language stack itself, offering a standardized auto-formatting tool as an optional feature. This feature provides the benefit and tooling for PEP8 style conventions to create clean, structured, and consistent code across all projects. By integrating strict coding standards via black-style tooling while allowing for flexibility for developer choice, we believes this strikes the perfect balance for a language.

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/whitespace.jac"
```

#### Type System

While Python has dynamic typing with optional type hints, Jac takes it a small step further. Type hints in Jac are mandatory in function/method signatures and for object class member vairables. It's really not that much work, and provides key benefits of statically typed languages such as better code understanding, fewer programming errors and better performance. However, Jac still allows dynamic typing under the hood to be fully semantically interoperable with Python, and offer the pythonic flexibility of a dynamically typed language.

An additional benefit of this restrained strict type hinting is the potential for type inference. With type hints provided at critical junctures (function/method signatures and class member variables), Jac is designed to allow complete inference of types for non-hinted definitions within code blocks. This introduces a whole new realm of possibilities for the language in the long term. One such potential is the ability to transition into a C++ compatible language backend, enabling Jac to target C/C++ and further extending the utility and flexibility of Jac. However, it is crucial to note that this is a future aspiration; as of now, Jac remains deeply rooted in Python's syntax and semantics.

By blending the best aspects of static and dynamic typing, along with the potential for type inference, Jac positions itself as a versatile language that can adapt to different development needs while maintaining a strong tie to Python's design principles.

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/type_hints.jac"
```
#### Improving on the class `self` reference

In Python, instance methods require the explicit mention of `self` as their first parameter for accessing instance data. This explicit declaration, although informative, can feel a little awkward and redundant to developers, especially given the language's propensity for clear and clean code.

Jac seeks to remedy this through introducing the `here` reference as s replacement as an implicit self-reference within each class method. This implicit reference is assumed in all methods, eliminating the need for developers to manually include it. The code thus becomes cleaner, more readable, and a bit more intuitive.

This alteration in Jac addresses a longstanding peculiarity in Python's object-oriented design. The repeated use of self in Python can seem a bit odd, particularly considering the language's dynamic nature. While Python utilizes self to ensure that instance methods have a way to access and modify instance data, Jac believes that this access can be assumed rather than explicitly stated, given the context of the method within a class.

Furthermore, Jac's approach aligns better with other object-oriented languages, where the current instance of the object within its methods is implicitly understood. By casting objects explicitly and assuming an implicit here reference, Jac simplifies method definitions and allows developers to focus on the logic of the method rather than the mechanics of accessing instance data.

##### Minimal Code Example
```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/no_here.jac"
```

#### OOP Access Modifiers

In Python, the visibility and access rights of class members are signified using a simple convention that employs the underscore (`_` and `__`). While this is a compact notation, it's often misunderstood and poorly enforced, leading to potential misuse and confusion. It can also appear as an afterthought or a makeshift solution, rather than a robust design choice.

Jac chooses to address this issue by incorporating explicit optional keywords to define class member visibility. The keywords `priv`, `prot`, and `pub` are used to indicate private, protected, and public access respectively. This is a more explicit and understandable approach, which significantly enhances code readability and clarity.

This enhancement is not just syntactical, but deeply semantic. The use of clear keywords provides predictability in class structure, making the classes easier to understand and maintain. The explicit nature of these keywords ensures developers have a precise understanding of the scope and accessibility of class members, leading to fewer mistakes and more efficient collaboration.

Moreover, the formal support for these accessors in Jac makes it straightforward to understand the structure and hierarchy o f class members, and the level of accessibility of each member. It's a simple yet significant shift that makes class designs more coherent and intuitive.

By transitioning from Python's underscore convention to the use of explicit keywords, Jac promotes predictability and readability, leading to a more structured and intuitive programming model.

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/access_info.jac"
```

#### Definitions and Declarations

As previously mentioned, in Python, there is a direct tie between declarations and definitions. When you declare a function or a class, you inherently provide its definition. This conjoined approach can be efficient in certain contexts, but forcing this approach when dealing with larger code bases present readability and organizational challenges. Often, understanding the interface of a class or a function requires scrolling through lines of implementation details, or relying on IDE tools for quick summaries. This can make it difficult to get a comprehensive overview of the class or function structure.

Jac introduces a distinction between declarations and definitions, directly addressing this challenge. In Jac, a programmer can first declare the structure of a class, outlining its methods and member variables, and subsequently provide the definitions or implementation details. This separation improves code readability and organization by enabling a clear, high-level overview of the class or function structure before diving into the implementation specifics. If a programmer chooses to conjoin declaration and definition, they can also do that as well.

This approach is particularly beneficial in large projects where different team members may be working on different parts of a class or function. With the separation of declarations and definitions, developers can quickly understand the interface of a class or function without having to navigate through the implementation details. This leads to a better collaborative environment and more efficient development process.

### Realizing Pythonic implemenations in a Jactastic way

Jac provides a comprehensive mapping of Python's core language features, ensuring Python developers can smoothly transition to Jac. At the same time, Jac introduces innovative modifications that enhance readability, explicitness, and flexibility, elevating the developer experience.


To ensure Jac provides a comprehensive coverage of Python's features, we provide analogous structures and functionalities for essential elements such as imports, global variables, free code at module level, Python-style function definitions, and Python-style class declarations, as well as a general mapping of code statements. Here, we detail these analogies.

### Imports in Jac, and Introducing Include

In Jac, the import system allows for two types of imports - 'jac' imports and 'py' imports, denoted as `import:jac ...` and `import:py ...` respectively. The syntax used for specifying the import paths is a direct mapping from the Python language's import syntax. This applies equally to both jac and py style imports. However, in Jac, the 'from' style imports have undergone a slight alteration, with the `name as new_name, ...` clauses being moved to the end of the sequence.

Also note that Jac's import system uses Python's `.` and `..` syntax for path specification in both jac and py style imports. This allows for consistency with existing Python syntax and understanding, and provides a seamless transition for developers familiar with Python's import system.

However, an important distinction lies in the elimination of wildcard imports like `from .mylib import *`, and its replacement with the `include` keyword. We view wildcarding as an issue of how to handle name visibility during standard imports. When a developer writes `include:jac .myjac;` or `include:py .mypy`, all element names within 'myjac' or 'mypy' are implicitly made available in the encompassing module. For instance, if an object named `Obj` exists within the included module, a developer can refer to `Obj` directly as `Obj` without the need to prefix it with `myjac.Obj`. Note however that the semantics of include are the same as import otherwise and do not behave like C/C++ includes. That is to mean a module is "executed" upon an include as with an import.

This introduction of `include` alongside `import` promotes ease of use and cleaner syntax when dealing with imported modules. This nuanced flexibility aligns with Jac's philosophy of providing explicit and intentional programming syntax while still maintaining the familiarity of Python conventions.

#### Minimal Code Example

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/imports.jac"
```

### Global Variables in Jac

In Jac, global variables are indicated using the `global` keyword. Similar to Python, these globals can be defined anywhere within the module. However, Jac was created with an emphasis on clarity and intentional programming; thus, globals must be explicitly marked with the `global` keyword to ensure that developers are conscious of their decision to use a global scope, thereby preventing potential conflicts and misunderstandings.

Supplementing the clear-cut design of Jac is the introduction of the global reference operator. With the potential for both global and local variables to share identical names, confusion may arise during code execution. To prevent this, the global reference operator can be used to unambiguously indicate that a global variable is being referred to.

The global reference operator in Jac can be represented in two equivalent forms, either `:global:` or `:g:`. When a variable name is surrounded by this operator, it is a clear indication that the variable in question is a global one.

Consider a scenario where you have a local and a global variable, both named `age`. If you simply call `age` in your code, it might be unclear or ambiguous whether you are referring to the local or global variable. However, by using the global reference operator `:global:age` or `:g:age` it becomes clear that you are explicitly referring to the global variable `age`.

This addition strengthens Jac's philosophy of explicitness and intentionality. It allows developers to maintain clarity in their codebase, preventing potential bugs caused by scoping issues, and promoting a high level of code readability.
#### Minimal Code Example

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/globals.jac"
```

### Module Level Free Coding in Jac

In Jac, the use of a `with entry {}` code block is designed to encapsulate free code. Free code is code that is not encapsulated within a function or method, allowing it to be executed at the global level of a program.

These `with entry {}` blocks can be utilized multiple times within a module, similar to how Python allows interspersed code statements along with functions and classes. Although Jac provides the flexibility of having multiple blocks, it is recommended to maintain a single `with entry {}` block for the sake of clarity and readability. An issue with Python is it does not dissuade excessive scattering of free code in a module that can lead to a fractured codebase, making the code harder to understand and maintain.

In Jac, even though the language permits free code, caution is strongly encouraged when deciding where and when to use these blocks. We view the `with entry {}` approach as an important improvement upon free code in pyton. It adds an additional layer of organization and readability. This results in a cleaner code base by providing a clear demarcation of code that is meant to be executed at the global level. This not only promotes the clarity of intention but also assists in maintaining a neat and tidy code structure. This is consistent with Jac's philosophy of facilitating clean, comprehensible code and explicit programming practices.

#### Minimal Code Example
```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/free_code.jac"
```
### Functions in Jac

In the Jac programming language, the `can` keyword is used in place of Python's `def` to declare a function, followed by the function's name, maintaining a structure similar to Python. Though the data spatial programming model doesn't need functions, the design decision to have these "module level can's" allows Python developers to transition to Jac smoothly, as the semantics and structures of Python's function definitions remain largely identical.

One unique aspect of function handling in Jac is the introduction of `has` variables along with pythonic variable definitions. These variables behave similarly to static variables in languages like C/C++, Java, and C#. Unlike other variables that are reinitialized every time a function is called, a `has` variable retains its value between function calls, making it a valuable tool for certain programming tasks. Python does not natively support this concept of static variables, Jac rectifies this gap.

Jac functions follows Python's dynamic typing approach inside the function's body. No type hints are required here. However, Jac does make type hints mandatory for function parameters to ensure type safety at function boundaries. Also, the type of the return value is required to be indicated in the function's signature. As an aside, A nice property of this approach is all variable types within functions are perfectly inferable, allowing strongly typed semantics without type specification in the body of the function and interestingly creating a foundation for new and interesting type semantics, though that is for future work.

It is important to note that unlike Python, Jac does not support returning multiple values directly in its return statement. From our perspective, this design choice enhances readability by reducing potential ambiguities. Instead of returning multiple values, we suggest wrapping these values in a collection object like a list, tuple, set, or dict, depending on the use case. This aligns with Jac's aim to provide a more explicit, intuitive, and efficient programming experience.



#### Minimal Code Example

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/func.jac"
```
### Classes in Jac

In Jac, pythonic class declarations take on a slightly different syntax compared to Python, using the `object` keyword as opposed to `class`. This `object` notion along with a few others are key primitives in Jac's unique data spatial programming approach and capable of embodying various data spatial semantics. However, it also fully subsumes and maps to Python's class semantics so we discuss `object`s through this lens here. Later we'll delve into `object`s through a data spatial lens.

#### Constructor, spawning, self referencing, and access modifiers
A slight departure from Python is the replacement of the `__init__` method with simply `init` in Jac. This `init` method serves as the constructor function in a Jac object, initiating the object's state. `init` can be made private using the `priv` keyword.

Jac introduces a robust system of access modifiers, unlike Python which relies on the `_` and `__` conventions. Jac's 'priv', 'prot', and 'pub' keywords provide explicit control over access levels to the properties and methods of an object. These keywords represent private, protected, and public access modifiers respectively, providing a level of encapsulation more akin to other languages such as C++ or Java.

 There is also no need to specify the `self` keyword in method signatures. This has always felt awkward and redundant in Python. Instead, Jac implies its presence and uses of the `here` keyword to refer to the enclosing object instance.


```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/basic_class.jac"
```

In this example, we have a `Person` object with two properties: `name` and `age`. The `prot` keyword before `age` indicates that `age` is a protected property (only visible to it's class members and sub class members). Similarly, the `pub` keyword before `name` indicates that `name` is a public property (can be accessed via `.name` everywhere).

The constructor function is declared using `priv: can init(name: str, age: int) -> None`. This `init` function initializes the `Person` object's state. The `priv` keyword denotes that `init` is a private method, meaning it can only be accessed within the `Person` object. The method takes two arguments: `name` and `age`.

Inside the `init` method, we use the `here` keyword instead of `self`, which is traditionally used in Python. The `here` keyword refers to the instance of the `Person` object being manipulated, similar to how `self` works in Python.

Next, we have the `greet` method, which is a public method as denoted by the `pub` keyword. This method prints a greeting message using the `name` and `age` properties.

By switching from `self` to `here`, and from `__init__` to `init`, Jac brings a cleaner and more straightforward syntax for defining and initializing objects. With the introduction of access modifiers (`priv`, `prot` and `pub`), Jac provides a more robust system than `_` and `__` for encapsulating properties and methods within an object, aligning closer to other languages such as C++, Java, and C#. At the same time its all optional and up to the developer if they'd like a more pythonic less pedantic style ot implementation as per:

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/basic_class_pylike.jac"
```
#### Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that allows one class (or `object` in Jac) to inherit the properties and methods of another. This helps promote code reusability and can lead to a more logical, hierarchical object structure.

Similar to Python, Jac allows for both single and multiple inheritance. Here's how you might define a simple single inheritance scenario:

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/class_inherit.jac"
```

In this example, `Child` is a subclass of `Parent` and inherits all properties and methods of `Parent`. This means instances of `Child` can also invoke the `speak()` method.

Multiple inheritance, a concept where a class can inherit from more than one superclass, is also supported:

```jac
--8<-- "examples/micro/class_multi_inherit.jac"
```

In this case, `Child` is a subclass of both `Mom` and `Dad` and inherits all their methods. Therefore, instances of `Child` can invoke both `calm()` and `excite()` methods.

When it comes to method overriding (i.e., a subclass providing a different implementation of a method already defined in its superclass), the subclass can simply define the method with the same name. If the method is called on the subclass, Jac will prioritize its own implementation over the inherited one.

Furthermore, if a method in a superclass needs to be invoked from the subclass, it can be done using the object reference op `:o:` and the particular object type name, following the same convention as in Python. Super() is less explicit and potentially confusing so its not present in Jac at the moment (though this is under consideration for future versions).

These inheritance semantics enable Jac to utilize the powerful constructs of object-oriented programming, providing a familiar and flexible paradigm for Python developers.


### Exception Handling in Jac

Jac Exceptions build directly upon Python's exceptions including `try`, `except`, `finally` and `raise` keywords using the same semantics (and imported Exception objects) as python. Jac also imports Python's hierarchy of exceptions with base class `Exception` and supporting the various built-ins like `IOError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, and `KeyError`, etc. Users can define their own exceptions by creating a new subclass of the `Exception` class or any of its descendants.

The `try` block wraps around a section of code for which exceptions will be checked. If an exception is raised in the `try` block, the flow of control immediately passes to an appropriate `except` block that handles that exception. If no exception is raised, the `except` blocks are skipped.

Multiple `except` clauses can be defined to handle various types of exceptions. Each `except` clause specifies the type of exception it handles, and if an exception of that type or a subtype thereof is raised in the `try` block, that `except` clause handles it. An `except` clause with no exception type specified will catch all exceptions that are not caught by an earlier `except` clause.

The `finally` keyword is used for specifying actions that must be executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. Code under the `finally` block will always execute after the `try` and `except` blocks, even if they include a `return`, `continue`, or `break` statement, or if an exception is raised that isn't caught.

The `raise` keyword is used to trigger an exception manually and can be followed by the name of the exception to be raised.

### Code Statements amd Expressions in Jac

For general code statements and expression, we provide an equivalency set that mirrors Python's structures. We've also expanded on the capabilities described here with the new language features that add additional functionality and flexibility to the Jac programming language. These are discussed in the next section (Purple Pill). Here we describe the basic equivalency set.
