# Origin Story

The journey of Jac began with a project called **Jaseci** (1.0, there will be a 2.0 when Jac is done), where Jac found its first realization as an interpreted language. This prior version of Jac, along with Jaseci, was used to create multiple software stacks a few of which became commercial products in production today. It was loved by the small group of coders who had the opportunity to use it and build with it. However, this prior Jac/Jaseci stack was interpreted with a separate ecosystem than Python and only allowed expressing strictly Data Spatial programs while having a small ecosystem of libraries and tools around it.

Over the past three years, we've learned a lot within this small community. We've understood more about what works and what doesn't, what coders love, and what they need. The fruits of this learning are being reincarnated in this new, ambitious, and what I expect to be the final major revised version of Jac.
The scope of this iteration of Jac is indeed massive, but with discipline and hard work it will be realized. It's designed to be a complete programming option for coders everywhere.

Jac's builds upon Python much like Typescript or Elm builds upon Javascript. However, Jac includes a large scope of what we believe to be good ideas to add to Python and programming in general. These includes a number of constructs from other cutting edge languages and the beloved data spatial programming constructs introduced with the original Jac. Jac's intermediate representation is pure Python, so there is very little risk for coming on board, If you want to eject, grab the pretty python and go ;-).

## Where Are We today

Jac doesn't have a big backing company (yet), nor a team of paid coders in a company, nor vast resources to fund the project as many successful languages have had. What is guaranteed is the fact that there's a deep reservoir of determination in Jac's creator, and a couple brilliant coders around Jac who are committed to the vision and excited to see what the future holds.

We're very open and welcoming of anyone who might be open to catching the Jac bug. If you're interested in being part of this project and learn more, please feel free to reach out. We'd love to hear from you. We have quite a journey ahead of us, but with dedication and collaboration, we're confident we can make Jac a beloved part of every coder's toolkit.

## About Jac's Creator

Hello, I'm Jason Mars, the creator and BDFL (for now at least) of Jac and it's data spatial programming model. I'm a computer enthusiast, a comp. sci. prof, a tech entrepreneur, an avid coder, a gamer, etc. I aim to bring the insights I've gain through these roles to the creation of Jac to make it useful, practical, and beautiful, oh and FUN!!
